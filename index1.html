                    - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds<br>
                    - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score<br>
                    - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn<br>
                    - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn<br>
                    - The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game<br>
